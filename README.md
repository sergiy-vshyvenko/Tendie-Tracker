# Tendie-Tracker
A (deprecated) web app for tracking expenses and budgets.

⛔ This project is currently DEPRECATED and no longer maintained.

What are tendies?
Basically, money. Internet people call money 'tendies' and it's a word play on 'tender' (i.e. legal currency) and chicken tenders the food ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Run it locally (written for Windows and VSCode)
1) Create a directory and clone the repo in it:
```
git clone https://github.com/eddyharrington/Tendie-Tracker
```
2) Create your virtual environment:
```
python -m venv env
```
3) Activate your virtual environment:
```
env\bin\activate
```
4) Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5) Create the DB in Postgres (schema in repo [here](./dbCreateStatements-Postgres.txt))

6) Set your environment variables in .env file (otherwise hard code the string ```app.secret_key``` in app.py and ```engine``` in all of the ```.py``` files):
```
# App variable
SECRET_KEY=someRandomStringOfText

# DB variable
DATABASE_URL=postgres://{user}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database-name}
```
7) Build and run the Flask app in VSCode

## Discussion
I started working on this in March 2020 as part of my CS50 final project. My main goal was to replace an Excel file I was using for tracking expenses and originally this app had only 1 form and 2 or 3 pages on it. The pandemic gave me extra time to think and explore different technology so I ended up adding features that I was curious to learn about. Some of the other things I wanted to add and may work on at a later time include:
  * Tests
  * User intro / walk-through of the app
  * Improved budget tracking (i.e calculates if your weekly / monthly spending is on-track or not)
  * Dark theme
  * Suggested spend categories
